# Ideas-for-Coding
Just some ideas that I think about coding, feel free to help me out!

1: I feel like starting off a little bit small, maybe with modding a simple game? Like Terraria, or another game that might be small and easy to mod.
I have most of my coding experience set around Java, and have learnt to use Doctor Java as my coding engine in school. I have played around with
Lua before, but never really learnt. I also used GameMaker before to code a simple asteroids game too, with the help of a tutorial of course.
